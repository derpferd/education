# education
This is repository where to store any education materials for sharing.
Each folder corresponds to one homework assignment and has necessary
NS file and scripts to run the assignment.

Each folder also has check.sh that is ran by supplying
experiment and project name arguments like this:
   bash check.sh buffer Share
This will check that experiment buffer in project Share,
which should be swapped in, is properly set up for a given homework.

When a new OS version is released and replaces Ubuntu-STD the idea is
to do the following for each exercise:
   - swap it in using NS file from the given folder
   - run check.sh to verify that everything still runs

Each folder also has html directory, which contains all the
files needed to display assignments to students.
