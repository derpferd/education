<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this exercise, we are going to use the PAWS simulator developed by S.
 Wei and Dr. J. Mirkovic <a 
href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1070162" target="new">[1]</a>
using the DETER testbed. PAWS is a discrete time packet-level simulator
which simulates a realistic Internet model and the background traffic
load, enabling investigation of possible congestion effects and
sufferings of legitimate traffic during a worm attack. PAWS supports
various user-customizable parameters that enable testing of different
worm characteristics, host and network diversity models.
Before you do this experiment, you should read carefully the reference
papers <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Emirkovic/publications/trident09.pdf" 
target="new">[2]</a>,
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948197" target="new">[3]</a>,<a
 href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/%7Esavage/papers/OSDI04.pdf" target="new">[8]</a>,
<a 
href="http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/%7Echuah/publications/paper-ijsn-revised.pdf"
 target="new">[9]</a>.


In this exercise, you will replicate an experiment which was carried out
 by the authors in <a 
href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948197" target="new">[3]</a>
to evaluate how their proposed host-based dynamic quarantine system can
help to contain Internet worm propagation. Table 1 lists the original
experiment settings in
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948197" target="new">[3]</a>
 and the configuration and customization of PAWS used in 
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Emirkovic/publications/trident09.pdf" 
target="new">[2]</a> to match the settings in <a 
href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=948197" target="new">[3]</a>.

<div class="level3"><h3>Setup</h3>


<p> PAWS experiment has been set up on DETER. To start the exercise log on to
<tt>users.deterlab.net</tt> and copy <tt>/share/education/WormModeling_Lehigh/paws.tgz</tt> into your home directory. Then untar it.  
The <b>paws.tgz</b> file contains the following files: </p><ul>

    <li><b>ASLinks.dat</b> - a file which contains all the inter-AS links with
corresponding bandwidth values assigned
        </li><li><b>BGPAtom2AS.dat</b> - a file which maps BGP atoms to the owner
ASes.
        </li><li><b>IPRangeTable.dat</b> - a file which contains all the IP ranges
with their owner BGP atoms and ASes.
</li></ul>

<h4>Generating and Logging Attacks</h4></a>

Attacks can be generated and logged using the following steps: 
<ol>
  </li><li>Log onto <b>node-0</b> using ssh  
  </li> Check to make sure that <b>/mnt/local</b> has already been mounted by 
the professor/TA. You should see the file <b>paws_RT.dat</b> file there.
   <li>In the <b>paws</b> directory (located in your home directory after the previous steps) change the value of PAWS_PORT in <tt>paws.h</tt> to some random number from 1000 to 65535. Then run <tt>make</tt>.
   </li><li>From the <b>node-0</b> ssh to <b>node-[1-8]</b>, and choose "yes" when asked if public key should be accepted. This step ensures that you can log onto <b>node-[1-8]</b> from <b>node-0</b> 
without password
prompts later.
<li> Run <b>./slammer</b> in the paws directory on <b>node-0</b>. This will run <b> paws_server </b> on node-0 and <b>paws_client</b> on 
<b>node-[1-8]</b> and create log files <b>log[1-8]</b> in the <b>paws</b> directory. Code may run slowly toward the end.
  </li><li> Run the script <tt>stop_paws</tt> when you have collected enough traces in the log files. This will kill all the paws related processes
in each node.
  </li><li>Do the analysis on the data contained in each log 
file. 
  </li><li> Modify <b>client.c</b> in the paws directory to include the quarantine effect and change 
the log filenames on each machine. Then, recompile and repeat the 
experiment. Analyze the new log files.
  </li></ol></div>

<span class="anchor" id="analysis"></span>
<div class="level3">
<h4>Analyzing the log files</h4></a>

You need to replicate the Slammer Worm experiment (note that this
choice can be made in <b>client.c</b> in the <b>paws</b> directory by choosing either
the <b>#define SLAMMER_WORM</b> or <b>WITTY_WORM</b> line and recompiling using <b>make</b>)
and plot two curves similar to Figure 1 in <a 
href="http://www.isi.edu/%7Emirkovic/publications/trident09.pdf" 
target="new">
Tools for Worm Experimentation on the DETER Testbed</a>.
The first plot should show how the number of infected hosts varies with
time for an original system and a quarantined system. The second plot
should show how the number of infected hosts and the number of
quarantined hosts vary with time. In your submitted report, you should
first describe briefly how Slammer worm spreads in the Internet and
summarize how the proposed host-based dynamic quarantine system works.
Then, include your plots and discuss the impacts of varying some of the
configuration parameters e.g. the quarantine rate.

<h3>What can go wrong</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Experiment cannot be swapped in</b>. First, check the error 
message you 
  will receive in the email. One reason may be that there is a 
lack of 
  available nodes in DETER and the error message will say so. This 
happens 
  ocassionally and usually resources become available in a few hours. If
 you 
  tried several times and could not find enough resources or could not 
diagnose 
  why the experiment was not swapping in, forward the error message you 
get from 
  DETER to your TA or instructor and they will talk to DETER operations team to resolve the problem.
 

  <p></p>
  </li><li><b> Node x Connection Closed</b>. Every student should use a 
different <b>PAWS_PORT</b> (in <b>paws.h</b>). Change the port number and see if
  the problem persists. Also, make sure that the instructor has put the 
<b>paws_RT.dat</b> file on <b>/mnt/local</b> of every machine
  <p></p>
  </li><li><b> Segmentation fault</b>. The segmentation fault may be 
caused by an incomplete <b>paws_RT.dat</b> file. A complete version of that 
file should be 
about  645 Mbytes long.
  <p></p>
  </li><li><b>All hosts share the same disk</b>. If you try to save 
trace on different hosts, please don't use the same file name; 
	otherwise, they will be saved to the same file. Currently, the log files are named as
<b> log$NODECOUNT.dat </b> in <b> slammer.sh </b>. Before you repeat your experiment for the scenario with quarantine effect, you should edit slammer.sh to
ensure that different log files are used for the new expt e.g. log_quarantine$NODECOUNT.dat

  <p></p>
  </li><li>Always <b>rerun make</b> in the <b>paws</b> directory if any <b>.c</b> or <b>.h</b>
file is modified. 


</div>

<span class="anchor" id="submission"></span> 
<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

Please submit your report and
your modified programs (only <b>.c</b> files are required). 
The
report should describe how Slammer worm spreads and how the proposed
host-based dynamic quarantine system works. It should also include your
plots (see section <a href="#analysis">Analyzing the log files</a> for more details) 
and your discussions on the impacts of varying some of the
configured parameters e.g. the quarantine rate.
The <b>.c</b> files should
not be included in the report but submitted as separate files.
