Hi all,

I've noticed that many of you are confused by our new addition to the office supplies -- mechanical pencils. I've put together a little FAQ.

Q: Do I throw this away when it's out of lead?
A: No! Mechanical pencils can be reloaded and used indefinitely!

Actually, i guess that's it! I've just noticed that people are throwing them away and this is not necessary!

Spare lead for the pencils is in the supply room.

Thanks,

Wilbar
