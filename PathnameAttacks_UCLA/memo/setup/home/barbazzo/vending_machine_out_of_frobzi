Hey all,

I just wanted to point out that, once again, the vending machine is out
of Frobzi. Of course, there is plenty of Diet Frobzi and Crystal
Frobzi... but no Frobzi.

I would like to register a formal complaint with The Powers That Be and
ask that please, would someone take care of this?

For crying out loud, we work at the Frobozz Magic Software Company, one
of the sister companies to the Frobozz Magic Beverage Company... how
hard can it be?!
