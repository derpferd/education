<h2>Overview</h2>
This exercise simulates a local experiment you might do with physical equipment, in which the equipment were supplied connected but unconfigured. You receive a mini-internetwork that can be viewed as a small scale model of the Internet. You are called upon to configure:

<ul>
<li>IP addressing
<li>route tables
<li>private address prohibition
<li>network address translation
<li>port forwarding
</ul>

You use the commands ifconfig, route, and iptables to do it. There are 5 nodes and in addition to using the commands correctly, you must understand on which nodes to do so and for what purposes. Proper working of the internetwork as a whole ultimately depends critically upon proper configuration in detail at all its constituent nodes.

<span class="anchor" id="intro"></span> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This exercise stems from <a href=internetworking2-instructions.htm>a hands-on class exercise</a> in which students use local equipment to construct a "scale model of the internet" that looks like this:</p>

<img src="internetworking2d.png">

<p>The central 4-router square represents the internet backbone, and there are 4 attached LANs. However DETER has a limited number of nodes and the point can be made with a smaller model. It might halve the number of workstations and could also reduce the 4-node "backbone" to a single machine "InternetSurrogateRouter." The new model looks like this:</p>

<img src="internetworking2g.png">

<p>But the final model you will use for this exercise can be still more node-economical. It looks like this:</p>

<img src="internetworking2i.png">

<p>It is spare, but as you work with it please recognize how it models the larger internet and that the methods you will use below to perform network address translation and port forwarding do not differ from doing it on the internet at large.</p>

<p>It's very important to understand NIC selection and enumeration (naming) in this experiment. DETER nodes generally have 5 ethernet interfaces (NICs). You don't fully control which get used nor what addresses they receive. An experiment node that uses a single NIC might use eth2 today, but eth5 when you repeat the experiment tomorrow. Imagine creating the equivalent of a DETER experiment, but with local equipment. When cabling two machines together, if they held 5 NICs each, you would need to pick particular NICs in which to plug your cable ends. You could use any free NIC you wanted, but once chosen you would have to be mindful which NICs you used. For example when conferring IP addresses you must apply the ifconfig command to the same NICs that possess the cable. Otherwise you do so in vain. Sniffing, you must apply Wireshark to those same interfaces. Otherwise you sniff in vain. Here you don't choose which NICs to "cable," DETER does. And you can't determine by visually following the cable since your experiment is remote, out of sight. So you will need some way to discover what is cabled to what, between nodes. The configuration file for this experiment, in effect, delivers you the above internetwork with cables already in place between certain NICs. But a) you don't know which ones, and b) DETER refrains from giving them addresses. We want DETER to stay out of that, since part of the exercise is for you do do the addressing yourself, then do routing that accords with it.</p> 

<span class="anchor" id="assignment"></span> 
<h2>Assignment Instructions</h2>

<span class="anchor" id="setup"></span>
<div class="level3"><h3>Setup</h3>

<p>It is assumed here you already have a DETER account and password, created following

<a href="http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci530l/instructions/lab-deter-account.htm">these instructions</a>. Please log in to DETER and "Begin an Experiment," naming it
&quot;internetworking-<i>xxx</i>&quot; (where <i>  xxx</i> is some suffix like your initials likely to be unique to avoid name conflict with other students' experiments) and loading in
<tt>/share/shared/Internetworking/internetworking.ns</tt> NS file.</p>

<p>Swap your new experiment in.</p>

<p>To interact with your nodes you need to gain an interface to each. You gain a terminal window interface to any of the nodes by "double ssh," connecting to users.isi.deterlab.net and from there to the node. For example, to connect to SWworkstation1:</p>


<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ssh  <your account name>@users.isi.deterlab.net<br>
ssh  SWworkstation1.<your experiment name>.<your project name>.isi.deterlab.net<br>
</font></p>


<p>Set up your monitor screen to contain 5 terminal windows, one to each of the experiment nodes arranged as in the graphic below. To do so first use ssh to get 5 terminal window connections to users.isi.deterlab.net, then from them again to the 5 nodes respectively as above. Once you are logged into a node, become root there, by executing (5 times, in the different terminal windows):</p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
<p>sudo su -   <font size="3" color="000000">(be sure to include the hyphen)</font></p>
</font></p>

<p>Your screen will look something like the following, with the windows stacked in the same order as in the above figure, and the title bars accessibly arranged for single-click selection of the window of any desired node.</p>

<img src="screen-arrangement.png">

<p>(As a possible alternative, there is a utility called "screen" installed on users.isi.deterlab.net. It is a character-mode program allowing you to open mulitple remote sessions and show them alternately or in split-screen.)</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<span class="anchor" id="addresses"></span>
<h4>1. Applying IP addresses</a></h4>


<p>Let's look at the initial state of your nodes, in terms of IP addressing. Visit each of them, and look:</p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig<br>
</font></p>

<p>You should see two interfaces with addresses. For purposes of interpreting your internetwork diagram you can overlook both. In the diagram, interfaces appear as the endpoints of the line segments between nodes (red dots in diagram below). There are eight. The two interfaces you just examined are separate from all of them. (One is the loopback interface, internal to the node; the other is the DETER control network address, by which DETER can communicate with nodes through a backchannel independent of their experiment-specific roles. The loopback interface will have address 127.0.0.1, the control interface will have a 192.168.0.x or similar.) So in effect, you've got unaddressed computers. If they are to have addresses and communicate, it's up to you to take care of it. You are going to have to use ifconfig to place addresses on the "line segment endpoints," or more specifically on the interfaces they represent. But you don't exactly know which ones they represent! Run ifconfig again on any node, with the -a ("all") option this time:</p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig -a<br>
</font></p>

<p>Several (probably 4) additional nodes are revealed, with no addresses on them. One of them (for workstations) or two (for routers) have cables to their neighboring node(s). The others are "cableless." You need to put addresses on the cabled ones (putting addresses on the cableless ones is OK, but useless). But the cables are invisible. So you need to identify which NICs have the cables and which don't. There is a script to help do that. It is called "showcabling" and must be run from users.isi.deterlab.net (as opposed to running from within any of your experiment nodes). On users.isi.deterlab.net:</p>


<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
/share/shared/Internetworking/showcabling &lt;experiment name&gt; &lt;project name&gt; <br>
</font></p>

<p>You should see something like:</p>

<pre>
[davidmor@users.isi.deterlab.net:~] > /share/shared/Internetworking/showcabling internetworking SMC-CS70

NWrouter eth4  <- is "wired" to ->  NWworkstation1 eth4
ISrouter eth4  <- is "wired" to ->  NWrouter eth1
ISrouter eth1  <- is "wired" to ->  SWrouter eth1
SWrouter eth4  <- is "wired" to ->  SWworkstation1 eth4

[davidmor@users.isi.deterlab.net:~] >
</pre>

<p>although the NIC numbers will generally differ. Write this down or redirect it to a file in your home directory so you can look at it or cat it for reference. I found it helpful to fill out a <a href=net-diagram.txt><b>paper map</b></a> identifying the interface names and IP addresses that go with them, for repeated referenece throughout the exercise. If you wish, print it out, fill in the interface names from the above "showcabling" output and the address values as they are assigned below. Bear in mind that if you swap your experiment out then swap in again at a later time to resume work, you will get different results from "showcabling" and will have to adjust accordingly. You will also lose the transient address assignments and route entries you're going to make below. So I suggest you set aside a block of time and try to do the exercise in a single sitting. Your interface names will also differ from mine. It's very important you use the right interface names in all the commands below that call for them. Where you see me use "eth4" for example, don't just type it and go. Your corresponding interface may bear the name "eth2" and you must be always analytical about it or you will find yourself doing more fixing than building. Having the paper map on your desk will greatly help keep you straight here.
</p>

<p>Now you will choose 4 networks (subnets), select 2 addresses from each, and apply those those to the NICs at opposite ends of each "cable." A network is defined by a network address and netmask (where the address is an integral multiple of the mask's implied network size). The networks for the end LANs (NW and SW) should be chosen from the private IP address ranges (described below). I will choose certain stand-in network addresses here. You may use them, or you might use your understanding of subnetting to choose different ones and, in any instructions below containing mine, substitute yours. Conceptually, let me choose and distribute the networks and addresses this way:</p>

<img src="address-distribution.png">

<p>Now implementationally let me apply this, below. If you chose your own addresses different from mine, you use my commands below only as a model. Use your addresses and masks, not mine. And also don't forget, use your interfaces as revealed by the "showcabling" script, not mine. Be careful not to waste your time putting addresses on the interfaces that have no cable attached!</p>


On NWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
	ifconfig eth4 172.16.16.2 netmask 255.255.255.248  <font size="3" color="#FF0000">use <i>your</i> interfaces and addresses here not mine!</font><br>
</font></p>

On NWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig eth4 172.16.16.1 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
ifconfig eth1 2.4.6.10 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
</font></p>

On ISrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig eth4 2.4.6.9  netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
ifconfig eth1 3.5.7.17 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
</font></p>

On SWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig eth1 3.5.7.18 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
ifconfig eth4 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>

</font></p>

On SWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ifconfig eth4 10.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.248<br>
</font></p>


Now make sure all these links are working. On ISrouter ping to the LAN routers in both directions, and on the LAN routers ping to the LAN workstations. On ISrouter: <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> ping 2.4.6.10<br>
ping 3.5.7.17<br>
</font></p>

On NWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 172.16.16.2<br>
</font></p>

On SWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 10.0.0.2<br>
</font></p>

Do not proceed unless these pings all get replies. If not, perhaps you flailed about a bit while doing all the ifconfig's and made some subsequent corrections. That may have left crud in your routing table, like duplicate entries to the same subnet but via different interfaces ("correct" was recorded but "incorrect" was not deleted, and the latter takes precedence). You may have to use appropriate spins of "route del..." to clean up. And/or you can use "ifconfig ethX 0" to pull IPs off of interfaces and corresponding routes from the route table. See the <a href="#glitches">What Can Go Wrong</a> section below.

<span class="anchor" id="routes"></span>
<h4>2. Inserting routes in route tables</a></h4>

<p>Set the 4 routing tables (one in each node) such that we have universal connectivity within our little 4-LAN, 5-node universe. There are a number of ways to do it. Explicit and/or default routes can be used. The idea is that each node requires knowledge how to dispatch a packet depending as it may be addressed to any of our internetwork's 4 constituent LANs. The tools for "educating" it are variantions of the route command:

<center><p><font>
Add route to a group of machines (<i>network route</i> -
local)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <b>route add -net 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0</b>&nbsp;<br>
Add route to a group of machines (<i>network route</i> - gatewayed)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <b>route add -net 192.168.5.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.4.1&nbsp;</b><br>
Add route to "any and all" (<i>default</i> route)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <b>route add default gw 192.168.4.1</b></font>
</p></center>


However we are proscribed on DETER from setting default routes. Those are spoken for, set as part of the aforementioned control network and not to be disturbed. We must use explicit routes, forgoing the last command in the list above.
Each machine needs a mix of local and gatewayed network routes-- local ones to those LANs of which the machine is member, gatewayed ones to those of which it is not. But the local ones were set automatically as side-effect of executing ifconfig so we don't have to do it. Check the route table on any machine to view the presence of an entry for each machine's local network(s):

On any node:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route -n<br>
</font></p>

We <i>do</i> have to add gatewayed routes to all networks to which a given node does <i>not</i> belong. Each workstation is a member of one of our 4 LANs, but there are 3 others to which it doesn't belong. Each router is a member of two of our 4 LANs, but there are 2 others to which it doesn't belong. Let's patch up everybody's routing tables so they know what to do with packets addressed to those networks that are remote to them:</p>

On NWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route add -net 2.4.6.8 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 172.16.16.1<br>  
route add -net 3.5.7.16 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 172.16.16.1<br>  
route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 172.16.16.1<br> 
</font></p>

On SWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route add -net 3.5.7.16 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 10.0.0.1<br>
route add -net 2.4.6.8 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 10.0.0.1<br>
route add -net 172.16.16.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 10.0.0.1<br>
</font></p>

On NWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route add -net 3.5.7.16 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 2.4.6.9<br>
route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 2.4.6.9<br>
</font></p>

On SWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route add -net 2.4.6.8 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 3.5.7.17<br>
route add -net 172.16.16.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 3.5.7.17<br>
</font></p>

On ISrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
route add -net 172.16.16.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 2.4.6.10 <br>
route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 3.5.7.18<br>
</font></p>

<p>At this point you should be able to ping every interface from every node. Please do some spot checking. In particular make sure the endpoints can ping each other as follows.</p>

On NWworkstation1:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 10.0.0.2
</font></p>

On SWworkstation1:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 172.16.16.2
</font></p>

<span class="anchor" id="privateIPs"></span> 
<h4>3. Blocking the same "private addresses" as the Internet</a></h4>

<p>If we are trying to simulate the Internet, we need to implement its prohibition against certain addresses. The internet dislikes all that begin with 10 or 192.168, and some that begin with 172. Two of our LANs (NW and SW) are like that. These are perfectly good addresses. They work just fine, as you saw in the section above. But the internet labels them "private addresses," meaning "not to be used on our internetwork" and constructs artificial prohibitions against them (defined in <a href=http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt>rfc1918</a>, "... packets with private source or destination addresses should not be forwarded across [inter-enterprise] links.  Routers in ... Internet service providers, are expected to be configured to reject (filter out) routing information about private networks."). Let's do exactly the same, in our Internet surrogate router.</p>

On ISrouter:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
iptables -I FORWARD -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP<br>
iptables -I FORWARD -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j DROP<br>
iptables -I FORWARD -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP<br>
iptables -I FORWARD -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP<br>
iptables -I FORWARD -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j DROP<br>
iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP<br>
</font></p>

<p>iptables is the command for building firewalls. Firewalls, famously, are in the business of blocking certain packets. That's what we're doing here. We are passing a law that says any packet addressed to ("-d" destination) or from ("-s" source) one of the 3 disapproved ranges is subject to arrest ("DROP") upon sight in ISrouter. Such a packet will be discarded there; it will not get though. That will put a stop to any pinging we might try from our customer LANs NW and SW. Check that by repeating your end-to-end ping attempts.</p>

On NWworkstation1:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 10.0.0.2
</font></p>

On SWworkstation1:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 172.16.16.2
</font></p>

These pings don't work anymore. Let them keep trying (they appear to hang). While they labor, go sniff network traffic on their local routers


On NWrouter, using whichever interface faces ISrouter (it's the one bearing IP 2.4.6.10):

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
tcpdump -nnti ethX icmp
</font></p>

On SWrouter, using whichever interface faces ISrouter (it's the one bearing IP 3.5.7.18):

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
tcpdump -nnti ethY icmp
</font></p>

You will see something like:

<pre>
root@swrouter:~# tcpdump -nnti eth1
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth2, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
IP 10.0.0.2 > 172.16.16.2: ICMP echo request, id 2630, seq 635, length 64
IP 10.0.0.2 > 172.16.16.2: ICMP echo request, id 2630, seq 636, length 64
IP 10.0.0.2 > 172.16.16.2: ICMP echo request, id 2630, seq 637, length 64
</pre>

here showing that the pings from SWworkstation1 that never reach their NWworkstation1 destination are at least getting as far as SWrouter from whence they even get released onto the wire that connects to ISrouter. This demonstrates that ISrouter is where they are dying, due to those firewall barriers we erected.


<span class="anchor" id="NAT"></span>
<h4>4. Configuring NAT in LAN routers</a></h4>

<p>Network address translation (a.k.a. NAT or IP masquerading) is a technique to overcome this communication disability suffered by privately addressed LAN nodes (the majority within home, school, and office networks). Internet-facing routers (like our NWrouter and SWrouter) do it by "lending" their operationally valid "public" IP addresses to packets coming from their workstations contaminated with the workstations' "private" ones. This diagram summarizes it:</p>


<center><img src="IPmasqeraing-scenario.png"></center>

<p>And these commands implement it.</p>

On NWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 172.16.16.0/29 -j SNAT --to 2.4.6.10
</font></p>

On SWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -s 10.0.0.0/29 -j SNAT --to 3.5.7.18
</font></p>

<p>The latter command for example says, to SWrouter, please apply to packets that are heading out ("-o eth1") whose source address is a 10-something, a source address swap ("SNAT" source network address translation) where you change the 10-something to ("--to") your own address ("3.5.7.18"). That's a good strategy because 10-something won't work out there and 3.5.7.18 will. Observe the effect by pinging from one of the endpoints to the opposite router, say NWworkstaion1 to SWrouter, and observe the ping packets as they pass through ISrouter.</p>

On NWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ping 3.5.7.18 
</font></p>

Simultaneously on ISrouter (substitute one of your ISrouter's operational interfaces for "ethX"):
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
tcpdump -nnti ethX
</font></p>

<p>You will note first of all that at NWworkstation1 the ping works (reports getting replies as usual). And secondly that the packets shown in transit through ISrouter do not bear the address of their originating node NWworkstation1 but rather that of the intermediate router NWrouter, which has bleached them clean of the offending private address. This is the essence of NAT and probably most closely part of your life if you use a commercial home router (Linksys, Netgear, Dlink) which all usually give your home machines private IPs, and implement NAT. Notice this doesn't really overcome the private IP prohibition, which remains in place, but circumvents it.</p>

<p>This still doesn't solve the end-to-end problem. You still can't ping from NWworkstation1 to SWworkstation1. That's because you solved the source half of that problem (eliminating 172.16.16.2 from the picture) but not the destination half (10.0.0.2 is just as bad, sufficient to fall afoul of ISrouter's prohibition).</p>


<span class="anchor" id="forwarding"></span>
<h4>5. Port forwarding</a></h4>

<p>The end-to-end problem can be helped by port forwarding, which has kinship with NAT in that it alters IP values in packets. Here is a general representation of port forwarding's operation:</p>

<center><img src="port-forwarding-scenario.png"></center>

<p>In our case, the Apache web server is running on SWworkstation1 and the lynx character-mode web browser is installed on NWworstation1. We want the latter to browse the former.</p>

<p>I would ask you to try it ("please execute 'lynx 10.0.0.2' on NWworkstation1) but won't bother because obviously it would fail (10.0.0.2 is poison!). I propose directing you to SWrouter instead ("please execute 'lynx 3.5.7.18'...). That's great! now NWworkstation1 has an operationally valid destination instead of a poison one. That's stupid! It's trying to browse a web server on a machine where there is none. But there's hope. With the addressing problem solved but the serverlessness problem created, what if we can solve the latter. We will ask SWrouter to recognize that packets addressed to it seeking a web server are not really intended for it, but rather for SWworkstation1. (Those are identifiable by the presence of "80" in the TCP segment header's destination port field.) We'll ask SWrouter to reissue copies of those packets with SWworkstation1's address on them so they'll get to the right machine. Remember, 10.0.0.2 is not poison here anymore. The only objection to it was out in the middle of the internetwork (on ISrouter). Here though, no problem. It will work.</p>


On SWrouter:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ethX -d 3.5.7.18/32 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.0.0.2
</font></p>

This says that arriving ("-i ethX") packets containing tcp segments ("-p tcp") with destination port 80 ("--dport 80") should have their IP headers' destination address changed ("DNAT" or destination network address translation) to ("--to") this machine's to 10.0.0.2 instead. Once that's done, the altered packet should be processed normally by the network machinery-- whereby the place it will get taken will be the place to which it's (newly) addressed).

Then on NWworkstation1:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
lynx 3.5.7.18
</font></p>

The browser receives the default page (it's identifiable so you'll recognize it when you see it), not from the node it addressed (3.5.7.18) but from the one holding the web server (10.0.0.2). Watch the result with a sniffer. While the browser requests and gets a page, sniff on SWrouter's external interface (I'll call it ethX), then while doing it again sniff on the internal one.

On SWrouter

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
tcpdump -nnti ethX 
</font></p>

Simultaneously on NWworkstaion1:
 
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
lynx 3.5.7.18
</font></p>

(or if lynx is already running, press ctrl-r to force a refresh). Note the source and destination addresses (<i>from</i> NWrouterdue to NAT there, <i>to</i> SWrouter). Then, switching from external to internal NIC (I'll call it ethY), on SWrouter:

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
tcpdump -nnti ethY 
</font></p>

Simultaneously on NWworkstaion1:
 
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
lynx 3.5.7.18
</font></p>

(or ctrl-r). Note the source and destination addresses (<i>from</i> NWrouter, <i>to</i> SWworkstation1 due to port forwarding here). 

<p>As a security note, please understand that while port forwarding works well and is a long-standing way to grant access to servers on machines behind internet routers, it provides no confidentiality. That is, the data is not encrypted. There are a variety of other methods, also in widespread use, to achieve the same access plus additionally take steps to encrypt the traffic (ssh, stunnel, OpenVPN).</p>

<h3>What can go wrong</h3>
You can mess up your route table entries. In that case, the commands that enter them (shown above) can be reversed by re-issuing them verbatim except for changing the "-A" (add) to "-D" (delete). You can mess up your firewall rules. You can examine regular firewall rules with "iptables -nL" and the NAT ones with "iptables -t nat -nL". You can flush out your firewall with "iptables -F" and "iptables -X". You can remove an individual firewall rule by re-issuing verbatim the iptables command that created it except for chaning the "-A" (add) or "-I" (insert) to "-D" (delete) instead. Worst case of course you could swap out and swap in again fresh. That will do away with any accumulated routing or firewalling crud, but also some of your work above which you would have to repeat.
