python-libtrace INSTALL instructions
------------------------------------

Requirements:

 * libtrace 3.0.21 or later
 * python 2.7 or later, 3.4 or later
 * ldns, which requires an up-to-date version of openssl

Installing python-libtrace
--------------------------

Check that you have the right version of libtrace, python, openssl
and ldns (as listed above).  For openssl on Ubuntu, you may need
to create a sumbolic link in /user/include, something like this:
  openssl -> /home/nevil/openssl-1.0.1j/include/openssl

tar zxf python-libtrace-x.y.tgz
  # Unpacks everything into directory python-libtrace-x.y

cd python-libtrace-x.y
make install-py2 # for python 2
or
make install-py3 # for python 3

The above series of commands will build python-libtrace and
install it into the place where python expects to find extension
modules on your system. python-libtrace can be built for both
python 2 and 3.
You'll probably need to use sudo for the make install step.

The library comes with a set of test cases. You can run them to
make sure the installation is complete. They are also useful, if
you want to make changes to the library. In this case, they can
be used to make sure your changes did not break anything in the
library.

To run the tests, go to the 'test' subdirectory and run the sript
'run_test' as follows:

export TZ=Pacific/Auckland  # Get the times right for trace file packets
<plt-folder>/test$ python run_test.py -d v2-test-cases/ -t

Similar set of test cases exists in 'v3-test-cases' subdirectory. If you
use python 3, you can use those test cases and run them using run_test
as follows:

<plt-folder>/test$ python3 run_test.py -d v3-test-cases/ -t

This command runs all test programs and reports the results. All tests
should pass to make sure the library works properly.

Using python-libtrace
---------------------

The best source of information on how to use libtrace and the 
tools that come with it is the libtrace wiki located at 
http://www.wand.net.nz/trac/libtrace/wiki

python-libtrace is documented in a set of html pages in the
doc subdirctory of the distribution.
A set of example programs is included in the doc/examples
subdirectory.

You should install these documentation files on a suitable
webserver at your site (or you can see them at
http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~nevil/python-libtrace/ )
