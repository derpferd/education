These instructions outline how to run a gamefied version of this exercise.

1. Swap in your competition just as a regular experiment

2. Run on users:
   perl /share/education/ResilientServerGamified_USC/start.pl expName projName
   --- wait about 10 mins for machines to come up after reboot ---

3. Run on users:
   perl /share/education/ResilientServerGamified_USC/gameon/start.pl expName projName

4. Run on users:
   perl /share/education/ResilientServerGamified_USC/gameon/gameon.pl expName projName blue red
   If you want to test blue team's functionalities set blue to 1 and red to 0,
   otherwise set red to 0 and blue to 1

   example
   perl /share/education/ResilientServerGamified_USC/gameon/flow_stats/gameon.pl cctfddos usc430 1 0
   or
   perl /share/education/ResilientServerGamified_USC/gameon/flow_stats/gameon.pl cctfddos usc430 0 1
   
   Monitoring occurs at 1 min granularity so any action takes 1-2 mins
   to show in monitoring log.

   Make sure to do monitoring first, before you launch any attacks or set
   filters up
