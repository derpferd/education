		<p>FrobozzCo is excited to participate in the exciting new WMW (Worldwide Magical Web)!</p>
		<p>As a test of the technology, we have set up an internal server linking some of our computerized services:</p>
		<p><ul>
			<li><a href="/cgi-bin/memo.cgi">FrobozzCo Memorandum System</a> : Have you read your memos today?</ p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>To publish a memo:</p>

				<ol><li> Create a directory named 'memo' in your home directory.</li>
					<li>Edit text files in that directory.</li>
					<li>Save the file using underscores (_) for spaces, e.g. "free_lunch".</li></ol>

				<p>To remove your memo from publication, simply delete the file from tme memo
				directory.</p>
						  
				</blockquote>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li><a href="/cgi-bin/FCCU.php">FrobozzCo Community Credit Union</a> : We're working for GUE!</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p><b>Please Note:</b> FrobozzCo's Frobnick Production Database (hosted by FrobozzCo's in-house http daemon, fhttpd) is available at port 8080 on this server. If you are attempting to access this resource from outside the company, you will need to use an additional ssh tunnel to access this resource.</p>
