Hi everyone,

As I have been elected quartermaster for this fiscal quarter, I feel compelled to point out that the post-it notes(tm) have been disappearing from the storage room at an alarming rate. I have also noticed a few "flip books" of satricial animation featuring our new CEO made out of post-its and I must conclude that these are the stolen ones. This must stop.

Thank you,

Wilbar
