To all employees,

Effective immediately the company will be removing the heating and air conditioning units from the building. This will have multiple positive effects: 1, it will save a lot of money. 2, the cramped closets where the units were located will be converted into offices.

Some of you may be receiving office relocation notices from me shortly.

Finally, complaints about this change or the building's temperature will be ignored.
